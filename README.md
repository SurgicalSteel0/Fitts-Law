# Fitts-Law

## Description
Fitts's law (often cited as Fitts' law) is a descriptive model of human movement primarily used in humanâ€“computer interaction and ergonomics. This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.
